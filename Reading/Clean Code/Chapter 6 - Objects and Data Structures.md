### Data Structures vs Objects
abstract interfaces allow its users to manipulate the essence of the data, without having to know it's implementation.

Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data.
Data structures (procedural code) expose their data and have no meaningful functions.

### Law of Demeter
a module should not know about the innards of the objects it manipulates.
